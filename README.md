xkarna
--------

16-bit custom computer from scratch. whole chipset will be built from *logic gates*. the
name **xkarna** is taken from [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fST82QdMkpM) great
concept album. I'm also thinking about making a working OS for xkarna after hardware is
finished. I'll definitely lose all my hair when it's finished but hey!
